      <h2>How I stay committed to learn</h2>
      <p class="gap">
        Achieving even the simplest of goals requires 
        us to learn the meaning of commitment. Throughout 
        our life, we are reminded of commitment, whether it’s 
        related to personal or business goals, and we realize 
        that without committing, we can’t achieve anything.
       </p>
      <p class="gap">
        When you think about it, everything you ever achieved 
        sprouted from a commitment you made, whether it’s your 
       children, your degree, your job, or even your house
     </p>
      <h2 class="gap">How did I get started</h2>
     <p class="gap">
     Programming is about solving problems. 
      Yes, it can take some time to get to grips with 
      specific languages, but there are plenty of resources 
      for every kind of learning style, regardless of your age 
      or your computer skills. In fact, plenty of companies hire 
      engineers without a degree.
      </p>
      <p class="gap">
       When writing code, all you need to do is save 
      the file as the correct type. For example, if you’re 
      using Python, you’d save your text file as a .py 
      instead of a .txt. You can make your life easier 
      by downloading Notepad++, which helps you spot where 
      you’ve made a mistake in your code.
      </p>
      <p class="gap">
        Coding Dojo offers the most serious 
        bootcamp in the industry. It’s the only
         bootcamp whose curriculum is designed 
         to teach you the three full stacks used 
         by the world’s top companies (most bootcamps 
         only teach one). Full and part-time online 
         coding courses are available. In addition 
         to allowing you to apply to more positions 
         with better salary ranges, a three-stack 
         curriculum allows you to grow with your 
         industry instead of having to return to school 
         to learn more programming languages.
